The <b>neuland.app</b> provides the new and unique way to improve the
student's life at TH Ingolstadt. It is an unofficial rewrite of the old

credentials. Afterwards, it provides the following fancy features:

<ul>
  <li>View your personal time table</li>
  <li>View your personal university calendar including exams and events</li>
  <li>View the canteen plans and meals</li>
  <li>View the university room plan and search for locations</li>
  <li>View and reserve available seats in the university's library</li>
  <li>View your grades and averages</li>
  <li>View the local public transport departure times</li>
  <li>View and filter available parking spaces in the city of Ingolstadt</li>
  <li>Completely FOSS and built for students by students</li>
</ul>
