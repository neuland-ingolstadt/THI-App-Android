# THI-App for Android

An open source, web-based replacement for the official app of the
Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt built with React and Next.js.

This repository only includes the files generated for Android
to automatically publish the resulting APK files. Take a look at the
[original repository](https://github.com/neuland-ingolstadt/THI-App)
which stores all relevant source code files and the documentation.

This project is licensed under AGPL-3.0 as well.
